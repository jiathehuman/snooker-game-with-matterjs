# Snooker Game with Matter.js and P5.js
This is a project done in fulfilment of CM2025 Graphics Programming module. The project involves simulated physics using P5.js and Matter.js library.

## ðŸ“¢    Key Features
- Simulated physics with speed, acceleration, object-boundary detection that emulates a real-world game of snooker
- Two player mode where your friend can operate a box to block your shots

## ðŸ¤–    Technical Highlights
Through this project, I learned how to use vectors and a Javascript physics engine to create one of the most popular online game. I also employed the Don't repeat yourself (DRY) software development principle by using modules to avoid duplicated and repetitive code.
